          <h1>Inspiration</h1>
          <p> When coming up with an idea for this website I came across many problems.
            I didn't know what to do. I had ideas but I had to consider copyright laws.
            I did not want to recieve and lawsuits in the mail. So I decided to think about public domain fairytails
            and how I can turn it into my own little thing. So I choose to go with Pinocchio. It
            seemed like a straight shot. a simple sea voyage going straight across the page with the boat
            moving as you scrolled. I also wanted to make it fun by adding whimsical sea creatures that you pass while looking for Pinocchio.<p>
